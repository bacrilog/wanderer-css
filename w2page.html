            <h1>SCARAMOUCHE</h1>
            <p>Initially conceived by Raiden Ei as a trial for the creation of an
                impervious puppet<br>infused with Gnosis, Scaramouche emerged as a successful experiment.<br>
                Despite plans to discard him, Ei opted to leave his destiny to fate,<br>
                sealing his powers and releasing him from slumber in Shakkei Pavilion.</p>
            <p>Reawakened, Scaramouche roamed Inazuma as a regular man until the Fatui took notice.<br>
                Modified by Fatui Harbinger Il Dottore, he was enhanced beyond his original design,<br>
                earning the moniker "The Balladeer". He emerged as an antagonist in various events,<br>
                aiding the Fatui in sowing discord. Following a defeat in Sumeru, he disappeared,<br>
                only to resurface erasing his existence to rewrite history.</p>
            <p><i>However, his actions merely led to oblivion rather than altering the past,<br>
                leaving him adrift as the Wanderer, yearning for purpose.</i></p>
