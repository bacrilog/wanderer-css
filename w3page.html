            <h1>WANDERER</h1>
            <p>The Wanderer came into existence in place of his previous incarnation
                <br>after the latter expunged his previous appellations and
                <br>their respective histories from Irminsul.</p>
            <p>Harboring his former self's memories after willingly regaining them,
            <br>"Wanderer" is now the only title he goes by, for he has no home, kin, or destination.</p>

                    <ul>His current incarnation was first teased on October 31, 2022<br>
                            and this was the first time players saw him in his redesign.<br>
                            FUN FACT: Bohemian Rhapsody was also released<br>in October 31, 1975.<br>
                            This song is assumed by many to be the inspiration for the<br>
                            character since there are many easter eggs hinting at it,<br>
                            especially, with one line literally saying his name.</ul></h4>

                        Wanderer is a Catalyst User in Genshin Impact<br>
                        and this is his Signature/BiS Weapon.<br>
                        This weapon will always run at the same time of Wanderer's,<br>
                        or as I named him myself, Kunimitsu's banner.
